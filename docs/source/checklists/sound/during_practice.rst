By the end of worship practice
================================

Gains normalized
----------------------------------

.. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

  The purpose of this is to get signal in all channels at roughly the same levels so that for any two channels,
    having faders at the same level or aux sends in the same position yields roughly the same levels.

- [_] Set all faders for channels that you will use to zero gain
- [_] Set gains on channels individually

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Ask each vocalist to sing and instrumentalist to play one at a time
    * Adjust the master gain so that signal is registered in the LEDs
      - it should hit the yellow LEDs occasionally, but not the reds. We want to avoid clipping.

- [_] Fine tune when they are playing as a group

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * As the group plays together, solo each channel and fine tune so that each vocalist/instrument sounds equally loud

Monitors balanced
-------------------

- [_] Set monitor sends to a baseline level
- [_] Listen to the aux sends soloed and ensure that the balance is as you expect
- [_] Note and address potential for feedback

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Listen for any early signs of feedback characterized by high pitched ringing
    * Solo channels to identify which channel is the primary culprit
    * Address by turning down the send of that channel to the monitor, adjusting the relative placement of microphone
      and monitor or turning down the monitor.
- [_] Balance from the stage

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * One person should go up to the stage
    * Person by person, they should stand behind the musician, point to them and indicate whether the level of their channel
      should be increased or decreased (by pointing up or down) in the monitor their in front of.
      * The center monitor is aux 1
      * All other monitors are aux 2

- [_] Ask the musicians who they would like to hear more or less of and adjust
- [_] Once the musicians are satisfied, listen to the aux sends so that you know what the balance should sound like
  so that you can maintain it throughout the service

Big House sound setup
-----------------------------------

Wireless mics tested
------------------------

- [_] Check battery level in all wireless mics

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Battery level of fair or above are ok to use for microphones just used for announcements
    * The battery level for the mic to be used for the sermon should be good
    * Discard any batteries below fair
    * If we're down to < 20 batteries, inform Matthew so that we can order new batteries

- [_] Confirm that wireless receivers are turned on
- [_] Test microphones

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Mute the wireless microphone output channels if there is still practice going on
    * Turn the wireless microphone on
    * Solo the microphone and speak into the channel - verify that you are able to hear speech
    * Turn the wireless microphone off
    * Unmute the channel


Ready translation equipment
-----------------------------------

- [_] Check battery level in wireless mic
- [_] Check that the receivers work

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Check that receiving units are on
    * Put on a receiver and check that speech into the wireless mic is heard in the headset

- [_] Put box of translation supplies at the foot of the sound area stairs

Attend pre-service meeting
----------------------------

- [_] Check with your team before you go to the meeting at 9:30

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Review checklists
    * Ask if there's anything that needs to be asked or shared at the meeting

- [_] Bring tested bodypack and powerpoint clicker to the meeting

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Lead Engineer attends the meeting in the pastor's office at 9:30
    * Take notes on answers to questions, changes to program or events that may need the team's attention
