During the Service
===================

Record the Sermon
------------------

- [_] Begin Recording in Audacity

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Open Audacity (headphones icon)
    * Verify that the track indicates that it will record in Mono
      * If it is set up to record stereo, close the track by pressing the X in the upper right of the track
      * Select Tracks -> Add New -> Mono Track
    * Press the Record (Red Circle) button

- [_] Adjust input levels

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * We want inputs to be as loud as possible to avoid having a high noise floor without clipping
    * If the level is not regularly reaching -6 dB on the Audacity monitor, turn the Aux 5 master up
    * If the level is reaching 0dB, turn the Aux 5 master down

- [_] Check that sermon mic set to send to Aux 5

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * The Aux 5 send on the mic(s) to be used for the sermon should be at 0dB

- [_] Make early sermon level adjustments

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Single voice levels are going to be different than worship levels.
      You may need to turn the master Aux 5 up once the sermon begins.
    * Do minimal adjustments at this time as we'll be able to adjust levels during the editing process.
      Results will be inconsistent if you have made adjustments throughout the sermon.
