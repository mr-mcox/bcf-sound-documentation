During the Service
===================

Establish balance and clarity
-------------------------------

Monitor auxiliary channels
----------------------------

- [_] Solo the monitor channels to ensure expected balance for musicians

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * The balance for each monitor should be consistent with how it sounded at the end of monitor balancing.
      It may not sound good on its own as it simply serves to reinforce what they can hear on stage.
    * Keep an ear out for any special requests that came in during practice
      - if vocalists said that they couldn't hear the leader during practice, take note of how the leader sounded
      relative to others in that Aux during practice and ensure that it sounds that way throughout the service.
    * Note that if you make any changes to coarse gains, you'll be affecting the amplification in the Auxiliary channels
      will increase as well and you should compensate accordingly

- [_] Solo Aux 6 to monitor lobby balance

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Sound coming from sources that are loud without amplification will likely need additional amplification in order
      to sound balanced in the lobby.

Record the Sermon
------------------

- [_] Begin Recording in Audacity

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Open Audacity (headphones icon)
    * Verify that the track indicates that it will record in Mono
      * If it is set up to record stereo, close the track by pressing the X in the upper right of the track
      * Select Tracks -> Add New -> Mono Track
    * Press the Record (Red Circle) button

- [_] Adjust input levels

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * We want inputs to be as loud as possible to avoid having a high noise floor without clipping
    * If the level is not regularly reaching -6 dB on the Audacity monitor, turn the Aux 5 master up
    * If the level is reaching 0dB, turn the Aux 5 master down

- [_] Check that sermon mic set to send to Aux 5

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * The Aux 5 send on the mic(s) to be used for the sermon should be at 0dB

- [_] Make early sermon level adjustments

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Single voice levels are going to be different than worship levels.
      You may need to turn the master Aux 5 up once the sermon begins.
    * Do minimal adjustments at this time as we'll be able to adjust levels during the editing process.
      Results will be inconsistent if you have made adjustments throughout the sermon.


Transition to sermon settings and back
----------------------------------------

- [_] When the sermon begins, turn down everything except what is needed for the sermon

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Mute all channels except for the one the speaker is using
    * Prioritize muting channels that are used by channels that may make noise as musicians move offstage
      eg a guitarist unplugging their guitar or a vocalist putting the mic back on the stand.
    * Turn down masters for Aux 1-4 since we don't want any noise coming through monitors
    * Don't change the faders as you'll want to resume from those settings later

- [_] When worship resumes after the sermon, undo what you did above

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Return the masters for Aux 1-4 to their previous settings
    * Unmute all channels needded for worship
      - you should be able to identify them because their faders will not be at the lowest setting.
    * Prioritize channels of the leaders, but wait until each musician is set up to minimize amplifying their setup.
