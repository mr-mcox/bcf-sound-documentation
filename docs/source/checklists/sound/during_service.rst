During the Service
===================

Establish balance and clarity
-------------------------------

.. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

  This is the most subjective and nuanced aspects running sound and is the heart of what you're doing to bring clarity
  and highlight beauty in worship. Don't take this as a linear checklist, but rather a set of guides to get you started.

- [_] Adjust balance within group

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Solo the each group (vocals, instruments) and listen to relative levels of signal
    * Are there any sources that are sticking out above the others? Do you desire that?
    * Are there sources that you'd expect to hear but are missing?
    * Listen to the group without the headphones - is the same balance present in the room?
      There will be cases when an instrument or vocalist needs less amplification.

- [_] Adjust group balance

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Listen to the levels through the mains
      * Can you hear the vocals just above the instruments?
      * Do the instruments provide a bed just below the vocals?

- [_] Adjust overall sound level so that slow RMS maxes just over 80dB

- [_] EQ individuals for clarity

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * As you are doing other tasks, listen for sources that don't sound natural
    * You may also solo individual channels to check that sources that don't sound natural
    * If the signal sounds muddy, it may have too much low end - make sure that the 100Hz high pass is engaged for
      all channels except for those that you desire to have lots of bass information - usually bass, often piano.
    * If it sounds thin, it may be missing too much lower frequency
    * If the signal sounds harsh or hissy, it may have too much high frequency
    * If it sounds dead or lifeless, it may not have enough high frequency
    * When using the parametric EQ, identify the frequency you want to cut or boost by cutting or boosting
      more than you think necessary and sweep the parametric knob back and forth until you find the frequency you wish
      to adjust, then bring the amount knob back until you cut or boost just enough.
    * In general, if you are using a good quality microphone, little EQ should be necessary. Usually you'll be cutting
      to solve problems, and occasionally boosting to bring something out.
    * Less is more in most cases

- [_] EQ to prevent collisions

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * There may be also cases when you cut frequencies to help instruments or vocals make space for each other.
    * For instance, you may notice that the piano and guitar sound great on their own, but when played together,
      It's difficult to hear the attack of the guitar.
      * To address this, you should identify the frequencies most important to make out the guitar
      * Then you should cut those frequencies in the conflicting instrument - in this case the piano
      * If done correctly, there should now be space in the frequency domain for the guitar to be heard

- [_] Bring solos forward

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Listen for instruments or vocals that are doing something special or important
    * Watch the body language of people on stage - they may indicate when they are about to do something special
    * Bring up the levels on those channels to bring the performance out
    * Discern when it is time to return the mix to what it was before


Monitor auxiliary channels
----------------------------

- [_] Solo the monitor channels to ensure expected balance for musicians

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * The balance for each monitor should be consistent with how it sounded at the end of monitor balancing.
      It may not sound good on its own as it simply serves to reinforce what they can hear on stage.
    * Keep an ear out for any special requests that came in during practice
      - if vocalists said that they couldn't hear the leader during practice, take note of how the leader sounded
      relative to others in that Aux during practice and ensure that it sounds that way throughout the service.
    * Note that if you make any changes to coarse gains, you'll be affecting the amplification in the Auxiliary channels
      will increase as well and you should compensate accordingly

- [_] Solo Aux 6 to monitor lobby balance

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Sound coming from sources that are loud without amplification will likely need additional amplification in order
      to sound balanced in the lobby.

Record the Sermon
------------------

- [_] Begin Recording in Audacity

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Open Audacity (headphones icon)
    * Verify that the track indicates that it will record in Mono
      * If it is set up to record stereo, close the track by pressing the X in the upper right of the track
      * Select Tracks -> Add New -> Mono Track
    * Press the Record (Red Circle) button

- [_] Adjust input levels

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * We want inputs to be as loud as possible to avoid having a high noise floor without clipping
    * If the level is not regularly reaching -6 dB on the Audacity monitor, turn the Aux 5 master up
    * If the level is reaching 0dB, turn the Aux 5 master down

- [_] Check that sermon mic set to send to Aux 5

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * The Aux 5 send on the mic(s) to be used for the sermon should be at 0dB

- [_] Make early sermon level adjustments

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Single voice levels are going to be different than worship levels.
      You may need to turn the master Aux 5 up once the sermon begins.
    * Do minimal adjustments at this time as we'll be able to adjust levels during the editing process.
      Results will be inconsistent if you have made adjustments throughout the sermon.


Transition to sermon settings and back
----------------------------------------

- [_] When the sermon begins, turn down everything except what is needed for the sermon

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Mute all channels except for the one the speaker is using
    * Prioritize muting channels that are used by channels that may make noise as musicians move offstage
      eg a guitarist unplugging their guitar or a vocalist putting the mic back on the stand.
    * Turn down masters for Aux 1-4 since we don't want any noise coming through monitors
    * Don't change the faders as you'll want to resume from those settings later

- [_] When worship resumes after the sermon, undo what you did above

  .. ifconfig:: detail in ('high')

    * Return the masters for Aux 1-4 to their previous settings
    * Unmute all channels needded for worship
      - you should be able to identify them because their faders will not be at the lowest setting.
    * Prioritize channels of the leaders, but wait until each musician is set up to minimize amplifying their setup.
