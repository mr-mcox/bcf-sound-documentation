During Worship
=================

House/Stream mix
-------------------
- A/B test stream vs house and bring into alignment

Correct balances
------------------
- Listen for any signals that are sticking out
- Solo buses and adjust balances within groups for blending

Shepherd energy within song
-----------------------------
- Make solos stand out by attenuating other signals or by amplifying soloist
- Attenuate signals in verses and bring them back during choruses
- Adjust balances for the feel of the song
- Adjust fx amounts for the feel of the song
